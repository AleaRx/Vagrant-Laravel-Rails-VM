## Get Started

* Download and Install [Vagrant][3]
* Download and Install [VirtualBox][4]
* Clone the Scotch Box [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-box)
* Run ``` vagrant up ```
* Access Your Project at  [http://192.168.33.10/][14]

## Basic Vagrant Commands


### Start or resume your server
```bash
vagrant up
```

### Pause your server
```bash
vagrant suspend
```

### Delete your server
```bash
vagrant destroy
```

### SSH into your server
```bash
vagrant ssh
```

- Username: root
- Password: root

## Updating the Box

Although not necessary, if you want to check for updates, just type:

```bash
vagrant box outdated
```

It will tell you if you are running the latest version or not, of the box. If it says you aren't, simply run:

```bash
vagrant box update
```


## Setting a Hostname

If you're like me, you prefer to develop at a domain name versus an IP address. If you want to get rid of the some-what ugly IP address, just add a record like the following example to your computer's host file.

```bash
192.168.33.10 whatever-i-want.local
```

Or if you want "www" to work as well, do:

```bash
192.168.33.10 whatever-i-want.local www.whatever-i-want.local
```

Technically you could also use a Vagrant Plugin like [Vagrant Hostmanager][15] to automatically update your host file when you run Vagrant Up. However, the purpose of Scotch Box is to have as little dependencies as possible so that it's always working when you run "vagrant up".
